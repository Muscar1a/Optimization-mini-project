1. Representation of VRP solution for genetic algorithm
- Form all routes as a permutation with (k + 1) number 0
2. Selection
- Reproduce the population 
    + Roulette wheel selection (RWS) 
    + Elitism selection (ES)
    + Rank selection (RS)
    + Stochastic universal sampling selection (SUSS) 
    + Tournament selection (TS)
3. Crossover Operators
- To avoid the duplicate delivery point, we may use 
    + Order crossover
    + Partially mapped crossover
    + Edge recombination crossover
    + Cycle crossover
4. Mutation operation
